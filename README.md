## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Comparison of Agile and Waterfall Methodologies
Agile:
Approach: Iterative & incremental
Flexibility: Highly adaptable to changes
Project Phases: Divided into short sprints/cycles
Requirements: Evolving, open to modifications
Testing: Continuous testing throughout development
Client Involvement: High—frequent feedback and collaboration
Delivery: Delivers functional increments frequently
Best For: Complex, dynamic projects requiring flexibility
Waterfall:
Approach: Linear & sequential
Flexibility: Rigid, changes are difficult to implement
Project Phases: Follows a strict phase-by-phase progression
Requirements: Fixed requirements defined at the beginning
Testing: Happens after development is complete
Client Involvement: Low—client mainly involved at the beginning and end
Delivery: Delivered as a complete product at the end
Best For: Well-defined projects with clear requirements

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial than Waterfall
Best for:

Projects with evolving requirements
High levels of uncertainty or innovation
Need for continuous feedback and iteration
Fast-paced development with frequent releases

Projects with fixed scope and requirements
Compliance-heavy industries requiring strict documentation
Large-scale projects with predictable outcomes
Projects where thorough upfront planning is essential
Examples:

Government Projects – Public sector software with strict regulatory compliance.
Construction Projects – A building cannot be redesigned mid-construction.
Financial & Banking Software – Requires security, accuracy, and regulatory approval.
Embedded Systems Development – Hardware/software integration with strict specifications.
Pharmaceutical Research & Development – Fixed processes and regulatory approvals.
